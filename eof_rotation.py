which can be found on github in at https://github.com/cghoffmann/mjoindices. 

The complete OMI algorithm is described in Kiladis, G.N., J. Dias, K.H. Straub, M.C. Wheeler, S.N. Tulich, K. Kikuchi, K.M.
Weickmann, and M.J. Ventrice, 2014: A Comparison of OLR and Circulation-Based Indices for Tracking the MJO.

The function :meth:'calc_eofs_from_olr_with_rotation' included in this file can be used instead of the function 
:meth:'calc_eofs_from_olr' in the original mjoindices package. The new method includes a projection and rotation postprocessing
step that reduces noise in the original EOF calculation.

    Postprocessing includes an alignment of EOF signs and a rotation algorithm that rotates the EOFs
    in three steps:
    1. Projects EOFs at DOY = n-1 onto EOF space for DOY = n. This is done to reduce spurious oscillations
    between EOFs on sequential days
    2. Rotate the projected EOFs by 1/366 (or 1/365) per day to ensure continuity across January to December
    3. Renormalize the EOFs to have a length of 1 (this is a small adjustment to account for small numerical
    errors).
