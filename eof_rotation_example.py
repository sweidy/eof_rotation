Calculating OMI with rotation

Use this file to generate the rotated OMI as described in Weidman, S., Kleiner, N., and Kuang, Z., 2022. 
A rotation procedure to improve seasonally varying Empirical Orthogonal Function bases for MJO indices, 
submitted to *Geophysical Research Letters*. (preprint can be found at https://doi.org/10.1002/essoar.10511626.1). 

The complete OMI algorithm is described in Kiladis, G.N., J. Dias, K.H. Straub, M.C. Wheeler, S.N. Tulich, K. Kikuchi, 
K.M. Weickmann, and M.J. Ventrice, 2014: A Comparison of OLR and Circulation-Based Indices for Tracking the MJO. 
Mon. Wea. Rev., 142, 1697â€“1715, https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-13-00301.1

General OMI functions from mjoindices python package published by Hoffmann, C.G., Kiladis, G.N., Gehne, M. 
and von Savigny, C., 2021. A Python Package to Calculate the OLR-Based Index of the Madden- Julian-Oscillation 
(OMI) in Climate Science and Weather Forecasting. Journal of Open Research Software, 9(1), p.9. 
DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.331 which can be found on github in at https://github.com/cghoffmann/mjoindices.

Rotation algorithm functions found at https://github.com/sweidy/eof_rotation at eof_rotation.py. 
Additional file rotation_plotting_tools.py in the same folder is used for organizing and plotting the PCs.
