This code is an add-on to the OMI calculation package published in Hoffmann, C.G., Kiladis, G.N., Gehne, M. and von Savigny, C., 2021.

The function :meth:'calc_eofs_from_olr_with_rotation' included in this file can be used instead of the function 
:meth:'calc_eofs_from_olr' in the original mjoindices package. The new method includes a projection and rotation postprocessing
step that reduces noise in the original EOF calculation. 

Postprocessing includes an alignment of EOF signs and a rotation algorithm that rotates the EOFs in three steps:
    1. Projects EOFs at DOY = n-1 onto EOF space for DOY = n. This is done to reduce spurious oscillations
    between EOFs on sequential days
    2. Rotate the projected EOFs by 1/366 (or 1/365) per day to ensure continuity across January to December
    3. Renormalize the EOFs to have a length of 1 (this is a small adjustment to account for small numerical
    errors).

The parameter :param no_leap: is currently not implemented in the original mjoindices package, but this is in progress. It may be
deleted for datasets that include leap years.
